A Python module that manages colors in an ANSI terminal emulator. The module includes:

1. An AnsiColorManager class with a nested Color class representing a color in the ANSI 256-color palette.

2. The Color class should:
	* Initialize with RGB values (0-5 range) and calculate the corresponding ANSI color code.
	* Include methods for:
		* Returning the ANSI color code.
		* Calculating and returning the color's luminosity.
		* Generating and returning a contrasting color based on a specified percentage.
		* Generating and returning the complementary color.
		* Printing text with the color as the background and a contrasting foreground color.

3. The AnsiColorManager class should include:
	* A static method generate_color_palette that takes a base Color object and generates a 16-color palette, including analogous colors, shades, tints, neutral colors, and variations to ensure uniqueness.
	* Static methods to print the first 16 system colors (0-15) and the grayscale colors (232-255).

4. Additional functions to:
	* Print the 6x6x6 color cube.
	* Visualize a given color palette in the terminal.
	* Demonstrate generating and printing 8 different color palettes with various base colors.

5. Ensure the script is PEP8 compliant, including appropriate docstrings, type hints, and code formatting.
Combine all these functionalities into a single script and ensure it runs correctly by including example usage in the __main__ block.
